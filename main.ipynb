Well that may be true. Even though I don't have DC, but looking at the records, did to the Sega fans I doubt DreamCast would become the best out in the market. If you remember to the older versions of Sega, what happened to their games? Yup all gone, they don't send anymore to the US evem before the DC came out, most people may have even forgot there was a Sega company. For those people who has\\/had Sega Saturn would know, it came out with many title of games and the next two years what happened to those games, well they stopped manufacturing them. Also what happend to the Sega Genesis console games??? Well same thing happened, they just stopped shipments. I dunno to much about history but so far I know one thing, history always repeats but in a different way, this time Sega's \\\"best console\\\" will just as well do the same thing like what it did in the past. They just stopped making the games. Well personally if your going to buy any console, I think that you should buy PS2 or wait for the X-Box, but not the next Ninetendo product (Dolphin) because they just don't make good games. Although I must admit Dreamcast does have good graphics. I also think that people who say the graphics of DC is better then PS2, I think they're just to weak to admit the two systems's graphics has no difference.\"])))\n",
